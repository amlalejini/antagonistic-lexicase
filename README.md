## Case study problems

- Minimal sorting networks
  - (Hillis, 1990) - original application of antagonistic co-evolution to optimization
    problems.
- Genetic improvement - fixing bugs in software
  - (Arcuri and Yao, 2008) - original application of co-evolving test cases with
    programs in context of GI
- Program synthesis benchmarks
  - (Helmuth et al., 2015) - set of program synthesis benchmarks on which lexicase
    selection has been applied extensively
